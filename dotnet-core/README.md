# dotnetCoreLogoPack
Logos for .NET Core, ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET Core MVC created by [www.campusmvp.es](http://www.campusmvp.es).

## Summary

Since Microsoft has not released any official logos for their new technology .NET Core, we've decided to design our own, Microsoft style, and share them with the world.

We think they look like the logo Microsoft itself would have designed.

We're giving away the designs in a lot of different formats for you to use.

We have logos for **.NET Core**:

![.NET Core](.NET Core/Bitmap RGB/NET-Core-Logo_2colors_Boxed_RGB_bitmap_BIG.png)

**ASP.NET Core**:

![ASP.NET Core](ASP.NET Core/Bitmap RGB/ASP.NET-Core-Logo_2colors_Boxed_RGB_bitmap_BIG.png)

and **ASP.NET Core MVC**:

![ASP.NET Core MVC](ASP.NET Core MVC/Bitmap RGB/ASP.NET-Core-MVC_Logo_2colors_Boxed_RGB_bitmap_BIG.png)

You can find the logos in this repository **in bitmap and vector formats and with different sizes and variations**.

We are not in any way related to Microsoft neither pretend to represent the company in any way. We're only a group of enthusiasts from the community that wanted to have a nice logo for our communications related to these technologies.
